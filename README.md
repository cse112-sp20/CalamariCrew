## User Guide

Welcome to Velocity Raptor! The extension that allows you to track your sprint velocity with a cool looking customizable raptor. Your raptor will run faster as you finish your GitHub issues! 

### Github Authentication

Upon opening the extension, you will be taken to a home screen with a link to login to GitHub. Click the "Link to GitHub" button, and you will be directed to a page asking you to input your GitHub credentials. After doing so, it will ask you for permission to access your repositories. Once you have given permission, authentication is complete!

### Setting Up

On the first usage of the extension, you will be asked to name your raptor. Note that foul language is not permitted. 

After naming your raptor, you will be prompted to select a repository. If you accidentally click away from the extension, you will be presented with the main screen of the extension when you return to it. You can add or change repositories by clicking the settings button, and then GitHub Repo, where you will find another list of your repositories.

**In order for issues to appear on the main screen, the repo you are synced to must have issues assigned to you that are also connected to an ongoing milestone.**

In the Settings tab, under "My VelocityRaptor", you can customize your velocityraptor with the given accessories. This customization will be reflected on the velocityraptor on the main screen.

### Resetting

To reset the extension, go to Settings->General, and click on the "Reset VelocityRaptor" button. There will be a surprise waiting for you!
