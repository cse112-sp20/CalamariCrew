# Calimari - QA (will fill in more later)

Skeleton framework for QA testing.

Libraries used:
- Selenide
- TestNG
- Maven 

# Get Started 

- Clone the project through git
- With Intellij IDEA, hit import project from existing sources
- When prompted, select the pom.xml file in the base directory 
- After that, everything should be correctly set up.

- Note that this should be useable with other IDEs as well, you would just need 
to use mvn (Maven) from the CLI. Although I think IDEA is smoothest for java programming,
since stuff like maven is managed automatically.
